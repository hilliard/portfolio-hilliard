            <p>I have been playing into music playing bass since I was in 
               elementary school. I started on trumpet but while playing James
               Brown, Sly Stone, The Jackson 5 and Charles Wright & The Watts 
               103rd Street Rhythm Band, my attention turned to the bass 
               guitar. In the 70’s I was the technical engineer for KGNU 
               Boulder while I was studying at CU. It was difficult to get 
               students/on air talent to show up for their shows and since I 
               was already there, they gave me a slot. My show was called 
               ‘Eclipse – The Shedding of a Blacker Light’. I played jazz, pop 
               r and b, but mostly funk. Cameo, Brothers Johnson, Larry Graham,
               Lakeside, ConFunkShun, Marcus Miller etc. Eclipse became the 
               first on-air presence for many of these performers. One night
               Warner Brothers sends me the album “For You”. The record company
               always suggested which song to play, but I chose “Soft & Wet”.
               In 1978 the song was considered too racy for on air play and the
               FCC ordered Prince and I to defend the song in a hearing. We 
               success fully justified it as ‘innuendo’.</p>

            <p>In 1980, Stevie Wonder comes to Boulder for the “Hotter Than 
               July” tour. While warming up in the Gren Room, we are jamming 
               on “All I Do“ (and Master Blaster of course). Stevie says “Hey 
               why don’t you come and tour with us, Nathan Watts is gonna 
               take over a project called WonderLove. I hemmed and hawed and 
               said no because I didn’t think I was ‘good enough’. I was 19  
               years old.  Good thing I didn’t cuz WonderLove did not fully 
               materialize and of course, Nate came back. Twenty years later 
               while working on test algorithms for FPGA microchips, (in my day
               job, I designed and built power systems for the Space Shuttle 
               and nuclear submarines (and black ops helicopters, but I can’t 
               say that))…
               it occurred to me that if Stevie Wonder asks you to play…You’re good enough.</p>

            <p>I’m five years old, living on an army base in Ft. Huachuca
               Arizona. Next door is this kid who’s always in the backyard 
               playing the saxophone. I grab the Quaker Oats oatmeal box and
               spoons and accompany him on drums. The neighbors ‘tolerate’ us.
               Fast forward a few years and I’ve torn my father’s hand built 
               stereo apart and connected my $50 bass to it. As my father 
               prepares to give me “what for”.. he sees the  “Album Open Our 
               Eyes” leaned against the speaker and he says, “That’s that boy”.
               I say what boy?, he says “Andrew Woolfolk” (Of EWF) the 
               neighbor you used to jam with. We drive to his house in Denver 
               and just ‘hang out’.</p>
