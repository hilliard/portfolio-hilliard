            <p>Hockey/Goalie Coach</p>
            <img src="img/lighted-ice-rink-3096.jpg" alt="cloud storage">
            <p>You can’t learn enough about being a goalie by just watching. 
               There are things you don’t understand until you try them. Along
               with watching great goalies, I attempted to find experts in the 
               area to help me. There weren’t a whole lot of local goalie 
               experts that one could easily locate. One of the beautiful 
               things about hockey is how nice and willing to share most people
               are (as long as they can determine that you are not in direct 
               competition with them). Other goalies are extremely helpful, but
               in most cases, they are either misinformed or just plain 
               mistaken. You do learn all the one-liners; don’t go down too
               early, hug the post, keep your glove up, face the shooter, etc.
               Every one of these generalities has a true application or a 
               contradiction. You could possibly become and 80% save goalie 
               facing the shooter, but to get to the 90th percentile, 
               you need to center your body on the puck. Grant Fuhr once said,
               “It’s not how fast you go down, it’s how fast you get up. ”</p>

            <p>Skills are things that are learned and developed. Goalies need
               the ability to start, stop and/or change direction, while 
               staying balanced and under control. Such agility, often termed 
               "athleticism", as well as speed are, two athletic 
               characteristics that were thought to be only "talents" and 
               impossible to coach. As strength and conditioning techniques
               have progressed, such characteristics have become teachable.
               Since goaltenders should never wander too far from the net, 
               skating speed should not be much of an issue but quickness
               and agility are. Elite goaltenders will be one of the best 
               athletes on the team. Goalies should practice by replicating
               patterns commonly used while making saves. A goalie can improve
               their athleticism. Studies have shown that 1000 repetitions 
               equate to a learned skill where as 2000 repetitions approach
               reflex. The game of hockey requires 236 unique skills and it
               takes approximately 15000 hours to prepare a player for the NHL.</p>
