            <p>Goalies are examples of a modern day gladiator or a present day 
               Darth Vader. Their equipment and mask afford the goalie an 
               opportunity to individually express themselves; the last bastion
               of personalization in a team based environment. The mask allows 
               them to express themselves without saying a word. Goalies must
               crave pressure. Goalies don’t score in games, but they can be 
               the difference between a win or a loss. Goalies must be 
               passionate about protecting the net. Although shooters take
               and miss shots, goalies are expected to make every save. The 
               puck must pass through five other players on the ice to get to
               the goalie, but it is the goalie whose measurement is judged 
               by goals against. Goalies enjoy being the last line of defense.
               They like the mental challenge of preparation and the attention
               to detail because one wrong move could cost them the game. 
               When goals are scored, most people blame the goalie; they may
               not see the terrible pass, bad defense, and lack of clearing 
               the puck, which led to the goal. A goalie is either the hero 
               in a win or the goat in a loss.</p>
           
            <p>There are attributes that every good goalie must possess. I call
                these attributes <strong>STOPPERs</strong>. Each item can vary
                in intensity but the great goalie must have them all. The <strong>STOPPER</strong>s are
                <Strong>S</Strong>kills, <strong>T</strong>alent, <strong>O</strong>pportunities, <strong>P</strong>hysical 
                presence, <strong>P</strong>sychological presence, <strong>E</strong>xperience, and <strong>R</strong>esources.</p>
                
            <p>I have seen a multitude of circumstances regarding goalies in
               the years I have coached hockey. Even though approximately 70 
               percent of winning a game is because of exceptional goaltending,
               it is almost always the most overlooked detail in hockey. Even
               the NHL thinks the fix for what ails hockey lies in the 
               goaltender. The problem happened a long time ago
               when the game got faster and the equipment came with it. 
               Goalies became more specialized, more athletic, and more 
               scientific. They ceased being the “spacey weird guy” and became
               intelligent students of the game. The say you can’t make it 
               through the playoffs without a great goalie, but very few teams
               or coaches understand the position or the person in that 
               position.There are many misconceptions about goalies in the 
               ranks of hockey, and many of them have little immediate effect 
               on the play and mindset of a goalie. I’ve seen some pretty 
               illogical and detrimental behavior perpetrated on goalies and
               I hope those incidents were soon forgotten. My purpose in 
               writing this is to give coaches a different perspective. 
               As a person who coaches, plays, and studied goalies, I hoped my 
               experiences would be helpful in other people’s understanding
               of the trials and tribulations the goalies go through to get to 
               where they are. With any luck, people like me can help people
               understand the differences between good and great goalies.
